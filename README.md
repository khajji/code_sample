# code_sample

This repository contains two folders:

java_sample: 
Contains a sample of Java code I have written that shows the code architecture (conception of different classes and dependencies between them) I used to structurize my code.

python_sample:
Contains a unique class of Python code that shows the way I have written the EM algorithm for Mixture of Multinomials so that I can use it as a blackbox for any context I need.
